You can pass an JavaScript object to the generate function to specity very presice what output you want.

```typescript
interface IGeneratorOptions { // The TypeScript interface representing the options object
    words: number;                  // how many words do you want to generate
    startWithLoremIpsum: boolean;   // force the generator to start with "lorem ipsum"
}
